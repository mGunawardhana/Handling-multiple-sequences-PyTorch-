This code loads a pre-trained DistilBERT model from HuggingFace for sequence classification. It tokenizes a given text sequence, converts the tokens into numerical IDs, and passes these IDs into the model to get classification results (logits). The steps are as follows:

Load Libraries and Model: The torch library and HuggingFace's AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForSequenceClassification are imported. A pre-trained model checkpoint for sentiment analysis (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) is loaded.
Tokenization: The sentence is tokenized (split into meaningful parts), and the tokens are converted into IDs that the model can understand.
Model Inference: The input IDs are fed into the model to generate the output logits (raw prediction scores).
